                  Any IT professional or hobbyist anticipating a solid
                  understanding of how blockchain technology works and desires
                  an understanding of blockchain's use cases and potential
                  (including cryptocurrencies and distributed applications)
                  needs to go through this course to leverage blockchain in new
                  or existing development projects. Anyone desiring to learn how
                  blockchain solutions are designed, configured, and developed
                  needs the knowldege and practice presented in this course.
                  This not only includes web, mobile, and service application
                  developers, but also architects, UI designers, testers, and
                  administrators. This course provides a solid understanding of
                  how blockchain technology works and a solid foundation for
                  platform evaluation and learning lower level details. This
                  course was built for forward-looking developers who create
                  solutions for mobile, web, and beyond. This course is designed
                  for those developers who want to begin working with blockchain
                  technology and need a good springboard to start their descent
                  into this deep and detailed set of technologies, theories, and
                  implementations. This course focuses on the primary components
                  of blockchain technology and weaves them together to create a
                  solid understanding of the blockchain stack component's
                  interactions and dependencies. Of course, the info presented
                  here is just as valuable for architects, testers, and product
                  managers as they too should understand how blockchain products
                  are designed and used to create the next level of distributed
                  ledger tech. This course IS NOT intended for non-technical
                  students. The content presented is in the context of technical
                  review. Before taking this course, a student should ideally
                  (but not absolutely) have some experience in: Creating
                  applications with Javascript Some exposure to
                  cryptocurrencies, either via the markets or from a technical
                  standpoint JavaScript development of complete web app
                  solutions<br /><br />
